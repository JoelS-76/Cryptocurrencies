# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this project is to group all trading cryptocurrencies for the client so that they can create an investment portfolio for their clients.

Since this is such a multifaceted dataset, it was necessary to use PCA to reduce the components of the data for visualization and analysis. We created both a 2-D and a 3-D scatter plot so the client can see the grouping and classification of the different cryptocurrencies.
